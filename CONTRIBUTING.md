## How to Get Started

Click the "Fork" button on the top-right of the repository page to make a copy of the project under your GitHub account.

### 3. Clone Your Fork
Clone the repository to your local machine for development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
```

### 4. Create a Branch
Work on your changes in a new branch to keep your main branch clean:

```bash
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

### 5. Make Your Changes
Implement your changes based on the issue you are addressing. Ensure your code follows the project’s coding standards.

### 6. Test Your Changes
Make sure your changes work by running the project tests (if available). Provide additional tests if required.

### 7. Commit Your Changes
Once you’re happy with your work, commit your changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Description of your changes"
```

### 8. Push Your Changes
Push your changes to your forked repository:

```bash
git push origin your-branch-name

### 9. Open a Pull Request
Submit a pull request (PR) to the original repository for review. Make sure to describe the changes you’ve made and link it to the relevant issue.

### 10. Wait for Review
The maintainers will review your contribution. If there are any changes requested, please address them promptly. Once approved, your contribution will be merged!
